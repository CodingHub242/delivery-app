# TODO for Worker Dashboard Styling and UI Improvements

## Completed
- Updated `worker-dashboard.page.html` to remove duplicate statistics cards and improve layout of hero section, quick actions, and recent orders.
- Enhanced `worker-dashboard.page.scss` with new styles for hero section, glass effect cards, button hover effects, and overall color scheme.
- Reviewed `worker-dashboard.page.ts` to understand component logic and data bindings.

## Pending
- Verify UI changes in the running app.
- Test toggle availability functionality.
- Test navigation to order acceptance page.
- Test data refresh on pull-to-refresh.

## Notes
- Styling uses custom colors and glass effect for better visual appeal.
- Currency formatted as GHS.
- Ratings currently hardcoded; may need API integration later.
