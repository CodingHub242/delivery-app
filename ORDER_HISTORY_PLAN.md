# Order History Feature Implementation Plan

## Current State
- API service has `getUserDeliveries(userId: number)` method
- Customer profile page has placeholder for order history
- Delivery tracking page already exists for tracking current orders

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Update Customer Profile Page (customer-profile.page.ts)
- Add ApiService dependency injection
- Add method to fetch user deliveries on component initialization
- Store deliveries in component state
- Add logic to separate current vs past orders
- Add method to navigate to delivery tracking for current orders

### 2. Update Customer Profile HTML (customer-profile.page.html)
- Add UI section for order history
- Display list of orders with details (date, status, items, etc.)
- Add "Track" button for current orders (status: preparing, in_transit)
- Add "View Details" for past orders (status: delivered, cancelled)

### 3. Add Order Model ✅ COMPLETED
- Created order/delivery model interface for type safety (order.model.ts)

### 4. Update API Service ✅ COMPLETED
- API service already has `getDelivery(id: number)` method for detailed order data
- No additional methods needed as existing API covers all required order data

### 5. Testing
- Test order history display with mock data
- Test navigation to delivery tracking
- Test order status filtering (current vs past)

## Expected Features
- Users can view their complete order history
- Current orders show tracking option
- Past orders show order details
- Order status is clearly displayed
- Order dates and items are visible
